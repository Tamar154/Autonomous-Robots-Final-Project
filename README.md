### Project Abstract: Simulation of Control Algorithms for a Tiny Drone

#### Project Topic
This project aims to develop an open-source platform for simulating control algorithms in tiny drones, focusing on enabling the drone to return to its starting point using sensor data and reinforcement learning (RL).

#### Background and Previous Work
Recent advancements in autonomous drones have integrated sensors and advanced control algorithms to enhance performance. This project builds on previous work from an autonomous robots course, where a Tello drone was modified with additional sensors and a flight controller, successfully performing autonomous tasks in simulation and real-world conditions.

#### Previous Work Highlights
1. [Article: Vision-Less Sensing for Autonomous Micro-Drones](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/16/5293): Deals with the modeling of a tiny drone (tello) to which sensors have been added, as well as a calculation controller (mission computer).
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have significantly improved drone navigation and control.
3. **Simulators**: Tools like AirSim and Gazebo provide advanced simulation capabilities for drones.

#### Project Goals
1. Finding a simulation platform for testing control algorithms in tiny drones.
2. Integrate RL to develop intelligent autonomous drones.
3. Ensure the drone can return to its starting point based on sensor data.
